Looplab demo site

Testing the newly learned Bootstrap skills using a video from udemy. This is the first of a few demo projects to combine the functions and features of bootstrap to create a reponsive website that contains features such as Scrollspy, Smooth scrolling events from the menu and Contact Us modal.

The site is a one pager with additional links not working. The top menu is fully functional as is the Contact Us button/modal in the footer section.
